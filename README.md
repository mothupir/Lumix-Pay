# Lumix-Pay

A crypto client-to-merchant and peer-to-peer payments system. The system consists of 3 sub-systems, namely a Web Self-Service App, an API, and a Mobile Wallet App. The Web App is for general purpose of creating accounts, viewing statements, cashing out and other general account management activities.
The Mobile App is for scanning and paying to merchants with Lumix Pay accounts, as well as peer to peer payments just by generating and scanning a qr code. So you can get paid and also pay others on the Mobile App.
The Api will inject checkout pages into Websites and Apps that have Lumix Pay enabled. The web pages will contain a qr code for Scan-To-Pay and also will be liked to number of wallet extensions.
